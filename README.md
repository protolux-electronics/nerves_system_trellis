# Nerves System Trellis

[![Hex version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/nerves_system_trellis.svg "Hex version")](https://hex.pm/packages/nerves_system_trellis)

This project provides the base Nerves System configuration for the Trellis
hardware platform. Unlike traditional single-board computers, Trellis is
designed as a hardware template for creating custom embedded devices.

## Hardware Platform

Trellis is a flexible design centered around the Allwinner T113-S4 SoC. This
dual-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor includes 256 MB of integrated DDR3 RAM, which
simplifies PCB routing and reduces the overall footprint of custom designs.

A Trellis-compatible design typically adheres to the following core
specifications:

- The system is based on the Allwinner T113-S4 SoC.
- Storage and booting are handled via an SDIO flash chip connected to the MMC0
  peripheral.
- High-speed wireless connectivity is provided by onboard SDIO WiFi modules,
  such as the Realtek RTL8188FU or RTL8723.

### Reference Designs

There are several open-source hardware projects that utilize the Trellis
template. These repositories provide KiCad source files that can be used as a
starting point for your own custom hardware.

- [Trellis Core](https://github.com/protolux-electronics/trellis_core) contains
  the primary KiCad source files for the base hardware template.
- [Wisteria Hardware](https://github.com/protolux-electronics/wisteria_hardware)
  is the hardware implementation used for the 2025 Goatmire conference name
  badge, demonstrating the template's use in a specific form factor.

## Features

This system configuration enables a standard set of peripherals across
Trellis-based hardware.

## Using

The most common way of creating a Nerves project using this system is to run
`mix nerves.new my_app` and export `MIX_TARGET=trellis`. See the [Getting
started guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/getting-started.html) for more
information.

Initial flashing of Trellis hardware is typically performed using FEL mode. This
allows you to load firmware onto a blank device over USB without needing an SD
card slot. You can find the necessary tools and instructions for this process in
the [usb_fel_loaders](https://github.com/gworkman/usb_fel_loaders) repository.

Once the initial firmware is loaded, standard Nerves over-the-air (OTA) updates
can be used for subsequent deployments.

If you need custom modifications to this system for your device, see the
[Nerves documentation on customizing
systems](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/customizing-systems.html).

## Linux kernel

The Linux kernel is built from the mainline 6.12 release with patches for the
Allwinner T113-S4. The default kernel configuration is in `linux_defconfig`.


## Special Thanks

Thank you to Connor Rigby who brought up initial support for the Allwinner
T113-S3.
